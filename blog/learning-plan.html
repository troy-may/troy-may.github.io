<h1>Learning Plan 2.0</h1>

<h4>"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself" - Leo Tolstoy</h4>
<br>
<h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
<br>
    <p>
        I want to become lord master of time and space and then I want to go to Europe as the old Steve Martin joke goes. To be brutally frank I don’t know what the long term goal is. I have started down this path out of curiosity and now I want to get through to the end of the bootcamp and build things. Maybe online courses, maybe one of many ideas I have for making some businesses none of which actually require that I can code but all of which will be better if I understand the technical complications underneath.
    </p>
<br>
<h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
<br>
    <p>
        Perhaps my strengths are in the area of reaching out and connecting with people, I certainly can’t rely on a superior intellect when it comes to code so it’s going to be about getting more hours in front of the screen and grinding through more code.
    </p>
<br>
<h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
<br>
    <p>
        I really feel it will be getting through the work in a timely fashion, avoiding the distractions and dealing with the reactance psychology of having to say no to lots of little chats during the day. Especially as it looks like we will be working remote I was hoping to channel my need for lots of face to face time into the cohort and facilitators with a bazillion questions.
    </p>
<br>
<h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<br>
    <p>
        This still remains working on the listening skills aspect of self improvement. Real listening is hard.
    </p>
<br>
<h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
<br>
    <p>
        My expectations have gone up, as I have realised that there is a huge amount of technical learning to be done and quite simply nothing beats direct face to face communication with people that know this stuff. That has only been shown so much more than I had thought over the last five weeks.
    </p>
<br>
<h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
<br>
    <p>
        For this I am still committed to making the most of this course and allocating the time necessary to complete the work. To time block appropriately and to my best to work within those time blocks. To keep my friends and family informed of my  commit to getting this work and learning done.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
        I am aware more than ever of the necessity of reaching out and communicating far earlier and more earnestly when I need help rather than slipping into stubborn frustration.

<h1>Learning Plan</h1>
<p class=dateposted>Sep, 04, 2021</p>
<br>

<h4>“Our knowledge can only be finite, while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite” ~ Karl Popper</h4>

<p>I’m here to learn the fundamentals of software development with the ultimate aim of being able to bring my own ideas to life.</p>
    
<p>I’m fully aware of the kinds of difficulties that learning new things and getting stuck can bring and have the following strategies as part of my plan to help me deal with these challenges.</p>
    
<h3>Listening</h3>
<p>Beyond technical skills, I aim to hone my listening skills as I really believe that most problems are communication problems. If I can’t listen I cannot understand. If I don’t understand how can I adjust, change or solve?</p>

<h3>Time Blocking</h3>
<p>I track my time in blocks scheduled into my daily planner and have let others around me understand what my time constraints are during this period.</p>
    
<p>I have allocated time to honour my mentoring and coaching commitments as well as time each day for the gym.</p>

<h3>Tracking</h3>
<p>As part of my time blocking I include daily metrics for my; mental wellbeing - doing the work, emotional wellbeing - taking breaks and breathers and physical wellbeing - exercise, sleep and good food.</p>
    
<p>I use these metrics as objective warning lights to give a heads up for the times when I get too deeply immersed In things. It’s better to reach out earlier than late if things start to drift.</p>
 
<h3>Expectations</h3>
<p>I expect that facilitators are here to support me on technical issues when I have exhausted my own problem solving approaches and give guidance with their experience if I find myself unable to meet commitments.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>My support network consists of friends and family who are already aware of the commitments required for this course of study.</p>
  
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>I will give support and help to my fellow students when and where I can.
</p>
    
<p>When all else fails have a laugh.</p>
