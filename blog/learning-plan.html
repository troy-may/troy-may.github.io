<h3>“Our knowledge can only be finite, while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite” ~ Karl Popper</h3>

<p>I’m here to learn the fundamentals of software development with the ultimate aim of being able to bring my own ideas to life.</p>
    
<p>I’m fully aware of the kinds of difficulties that learning new things and getting stuck can bring and have the following strategies as part of my plan to help me deal with these challenges.</p>
    
<p>Beyond technical skills, I aim to hone my listening skills as I really believe that most problems are communication problems. If I can’t listen I cannot understand. If I don’t understand how can I adjust, change or solve?</p>

<p>I track my time in blocks scheduled into my daily planner and have let others around me understand what my time constraints are during this period.</p>
    
<p>I have allocated time to honour my mentoring and coaching commitments as well as time each day for the gym.</p>
    
<p>As part of my time blocking I include daily metrics for my; mental wellbeing - doing the work, emotional wellbeing - taking breaks and breathers and physical wellbeing - exercise, sleep and good food.</p>
    
<p>I use these metrics as objective warning lights to give a heads up for the times when I get too deeply immersed In things. It’s better to reach out earlier than late if things start to drift.</p>
    
<p>I expect that facilitators are here to support me on technical issues when I have exhausted my own problem solving approaches and give guidance with their experience if I find myself unable to meet commitments.</p>

<p>My support network consists of friends, family who are already aware of the commitments required for this course of study.</p>
    
<p>I will give support and help to my fellow students when and where I can.
</p>

<p>Memento mori.</p>
    
<p>Have fun.</p>
