<h4>"Being yourself is a continuous effort” ~ James Clear</h4>


<h3>Moral Dilemmas</h3>
    
<p>Here's one situation that I’m sure many have considered but not often experienced. My business partner and I had a side business that is complicated to explain but on one of our first deals a client had to wire us a cool million US dollars direct to our account.</p>
    
<p>Seven figures USD $1,000,000.00 sitting in your bank account, staring at you.</p>

<p>It’s a lot of money and we sat in our office joking "what if we just took the money and ran?"</p>
    
<p>Neither of us would've taken the money, but it would be lying if I said we didn’t do some back of the envelope calculus.</p>

<p>For a long time we talked about why we wouldn’t take the money? What was behind our trustworthiness? In the end we had to admit that in a big way it’s our bonds to the people around us and the society we want to live in.</p>
    
<p>When we wired the money to our vendor, we sat waiting to see if his calculus and bond to society were the same as ours.</p>
    
<h3>Culture</h3>
    
<p>I grew up in NZ and spent some formative years in China.</p>
    
<p>From NZ I picked up the values of being loyal, independent, a good dose of kiwi appreciation for quirkiness and the enjoyment of a chat over a cuppa tea.</p>

<p>From China I got the importance of being pragmatic and flexible in how you see things, context is king. And the enjoyment of a chat over a cuppa tea</p>
    
<p>From both I found that at our core we are social creatures and the only measure that really counts is how we treat each other. It is the glue that binds and regulates society for better or worse.</p>
    
<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>According to Strengthfinder I’m an; Optimist, Problem Solver, Philomath, Brainstormer and Strategist.</p>
    
<p>All very flattering and I’m sure they’ve been of help in both my career and learning however I don’t think we should ever forget the value of simply doing the work. There's lots of luck involved in being at the right place and the right time (and having the willingness to take a risk).</p>
    
<p>My persistence can be a two edged sword when it comes to learning. Sometimes I have a tendency to circle around things from different angles at different times. I don’t always get things the first loop or around but if I stick with things long enough a lot of them come into focus. Other times I will be too dogged and not take the breaks or the loops needed to get the required perspective.</p>

<p>It’s not unusual to be working with people that don’t always gibe with your own world views or even the goals of the team in general. My standard approach for many years was to ignore or route around people but that never fixes the underlying issues.</p>
    
<p>As I’ve gotten older, listening, real listening. The kind where you aren’t just listening to find the gap to insert your own answer has been a important for me in connecting with people. It’s not 100%, it's hard work and sometimes lines in the sand are drawn and not much can change them. That’s ok.</p>
    
<p>But giving listening a real chance is always worth effort.</p>
    
<p>Have fun.</p>
