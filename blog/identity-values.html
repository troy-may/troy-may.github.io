<h4>"Being yourself is a continuous effort” ~ James Clear</h4>

    
<h3>Culture</h3>
    
<p>I grew up in NZ and spent many years in China.</p>
    
<p>From NZ I picked up the values of being loyal, independent, and an appreciation for quirkiness. From China I got the importance of being pragmatic and flexible in how you see things.</p>
    
<p>From both I found that the only measure that really counts is how we treat each other. It is the glue that binds.</p>
    
<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>According to Strengthfinder I’m an; Optimist, Problem Solver, Philomath, Brainstormer and Strategist.</p>
    
<p>All very flattering and perhaps they’ve been of help in my career and learning however I don’t think we should ever forget the value of simply doing the work. There's lots of luck involved in being at the right place and the right time and having the willingness to take a risk.</p>
    
<p>I'm persistent which can be a two edged sword. I don’t always get things on the first loop or around but I find if I stick with things long enough they start to make sense. However at times I'm so persistent that I hang on to the wrong things for way too long.</p>

<p>It’s not unusual to be working with people that don’t always gibe with your own world views. My standard approach for many years was to route around people but that never fixes the underlying issues.</p>
    
<p>There have been way too many times when I have simply been too short with people. If I could go back I would dial up the patience and give people more space to say their piece.</p>
    
<p>See the person in others before you see the need in yourself.</p>
    
<p>Memento Mori</p>
