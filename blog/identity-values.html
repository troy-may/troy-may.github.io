<h2>Values</h2>
<p class=date>Sep, 04, 2021</p>

<h3>"Being yourself is a continuous effort” ~ James Clear</h3>

<h3>Money</h3>
    
<p>One situation that I’m sure many have considered but not often experienced. My business partner and I had a side business that is complicated to explain but on one of our first deals a client had to wire us a cool million US dollars direct to our account.</p>
    
<p>Seven figures USD $1,000,000.00 sitting in your bank account, staring at you.</p>

<p>It’s a lot of money and we sat in our office joking,  "what if we just took the money and ran?"</p>
    
<p>Neither of us would have taken the money, but I would be lying if I said we didn’t do some back of the envelope calculus.</p>

<p>For a long time after we talked about why we wouldn’t take the money? What was behind our trustworthiness? In the end we had to admit that in a big way it’s fear that keeps us inline, the fear of breaking our bonds to the people around us and the society we want to live in.</p>
    
<p>When we wired the money to our vendor, we sat biting our nails, waiting to see if his calculus and bond to society was the same as ours.</p>
    
<h3>Culture</h3>
    
<p>I grew up in NZ but also spent a long formative time in China and it's fair to say there’s a few differences.</p>
    
<p>From NZ I picked up the values of being independent and not trying too hard to force your opinions on others. Along with a good dose of the kiwi appreciation for quirkiness and enjoying a cuppa tea. From China I got the need to be pragmatic and flexible in how you see things, context is king. And enjoying a cuppa tea</p>
    
<p>From both I found that at our core we are social creatures and the only measure that really counts is how we treat each other. It is the glue that binds and regulates society for better or worse.</p>
    
<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>According to Strengthfinder I’m an; Optimist, Problem Solver, Philomath, Brainstormer and Strategist.</p>
    
<p>All very flattering and I’m sure they’ve been of help in both my career and learning but I don’t think we should ever forget the value of doing the work and lots of luck in being at the right place and the right time (and the willingness to take a risk).</p>
    
<p>My persistence can be a two edged sword when it comes to learning. Sometimes I have a tendency to circle around things from different angles at different times. I don’t always get things the first loop or around but if I stick with things long enough a lot of them come into focus. Other times I will be too dogged and not take the breaks or the loops needed to get some perspective.</p>

<p>It’s not unusual to be working with people that don’t always gibe with your own world views or even the goals of the team in general. My standard approach for many years was to ignore or route around people but that never fixed the underlying issues.</p>
    
<p>As I’ve matured I have found listening, real listening the kind where you aren’t just listening to find the gap to insert your own answer has been a game changer in understanding and connecting with people. It’s not 100% and sometimes lines in the sand are drawn and that’s ok.</p>
    
<p>But giving listening a real chance is my preferred approach.</p>
    
<p>Have fun.</p>
