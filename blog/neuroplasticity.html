<h4>“Argue for your limitations and sure enough they’re yours” - Richard Bach</h4>

<h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>

<p>
  The fancy term “neuroplasticity” is the ability of the neural networks (the collection of cells that act as the circuits) in the brain to grow, change and reorganise themselves.
</p>

<p>
  Some scientists thought these high levels of plastic flexibility only really existed in childhood. We now know that our brains grow and change throughout our lives, and like the rest of our anatomy respond to the stresses and circumstances applied to them.
</p>

<p>
  We are supremely adaptive creatures, and our entire physiology is dominated by a simple rule “use it or lose it.” Whether it’s muscle, bone or brain nature doesn’t like to pay for things that aren’t being used. If it’s useful we get to keep it. In sports they have a term called SAID <strong>Specific Adaption to Imposed Demands.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The more we use something the better it gets at doing the things demanded of it. If we ask our muscles to lift heavier and heavier things our muscles, bones and brains get better at doing that. If we ask our brains to do non-linear calculus often enough our neurons sweat, complain and build stronger non-linear calculus networks.
</p>

<h3>Mindsets </h3>

<p>
  But just like building muscles it helps very much if you believe you can. Or at the very least are willing to try. For without that trying nothing will happen. The universe likes to run little loops and doesn’t seem to care whether they are positive or negative loops.
</p>

<p>
  The classic example being if you get off the sofa and make it to the gym things change your body adapts, if you don’t your body also adapts just not in the ways most of us really want. Nature doesn’t put value judgements on adaptations she just runs the loops that gives you the adaptations to the stresses you are imposing.
</p>

<p>
  It’s the doing that’s important and this is where having a growth mindset really shines. If your mindset says I can’t change I can’t do anything, I can’t learn this new thing. The universe will run that loop and reinforce that thinking.
</p>

<p>
  A growth mindset is one of Ok I’ll give it a try (even just a little bit) and runs the loop. The tiniest of changes happens, feeds back into the system and seeds the growth for the next run. Run that loop often enough and the adaptions grow in a positive direction.
</p>

<h4>This is what is known in the trade as a self fulfilling prophecy.</h4>
  
<p>
  So be careful of your habits because even though in the beginning you can only feel the tiniest of changes. As you run through the loop tens of thousands of times they can build to be mighty muscles and wonderful brains, or chains so strong you will struggle to break them
