<h4>“Everything about us – our brains, our minds, our bodies – is geared toward collaboration in social systems” - Bessel van der Kolk</h4>

<h3>Spock</h3>

<p>Measures of our ability to reason through abstract problems, visual puzzles, how much someone can store in memory short vs long term, and so on are usually placed under the umbrella of an Intelligence Quotient (IQ).</p>

<h3>Kirk</h3> 

<p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is defined as the measure of awareness that we have of both our own inner state and our relationships to the people around us. Our ability to recognise the feelings that others are experiencing. Our ability to appropriately moderate our responses to others and our ability to moderate our own expressions and behaviours.</p>

<h3>Why is it Important?</h3>

<p>We are deeply social creatures. We cannot survive alone. Every aspect of society is based upon cooperation of some form or other. Our intellectual successes are shared and validated through each other. Newton may have been one of the greatest intellects of all time but it would have made no difference if he had never communicated with the rest of the world. Our levels of wellbeing can be measured by our levels of connectedness and how adjusted we are to the people around us.</p>

<h3>New Frontiers</h3>

<p>For all of recorded history poets, philosophers, musicians and most the rest of the world has been intimately aware of Emotional Intelligence. What has changed in recent times is that we are finding better ways of quantifying EQ. We understand that we can improve our emotional skills. We have access to knowledge and practices that can help us more fully develop our emotional capacities.</p>

<p>Having the understanding that our emotional capacities can be developed through considered practice as much any other skill is a very important insight. We all literally stand on the shoulders of giants and just as importantly we all stand on the shoulders of each other.</p>

<p>Strengthening ourselves is strengthening everyone.</p>
