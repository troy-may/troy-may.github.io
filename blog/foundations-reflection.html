<h4>“People you trust will tell you the things you do not want to hear” - Rands</h4>
<br>
<h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
<br>
  <p>
    - I am way too stubborn I should have reached out for help far, far earlier, far more often than I did in the beginning of the course. My ego said you “should” have this the reality was my ego needed a good beating before it would let go and I could ask for help.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    - I knew I was good at procrastinating but I was taking things to a new level both in what I was doing to avoid facing into the code but I also became far more aware of the active actions I was taking to bring about the procrastination. I became more aware that things I was doing was for avoidance sake.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    - I had a rather large issue around looking at others code or ready made solutions. I felt it was wrong to do so. At one point I had to stop and ask for clarification, it felt like I was cheating. An old hangover from the school days of closed book exams which in reality is not the reality of solving real world coding problems today. I think I well and truly killed that attitude.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
<br>
  <p>
    - Getting the ego beaten up is a very good way of discovering some empathy for others. We are all social creatures and it can be very easy to look out at the world from a perspective of me myself and I, and not see how the others are suffering in the same ways that we suffer ourselves.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    - So often when talking to others in the course I had to smile and enjoy the recognition of a fellow shell shocked soldier and when we did acknowledge the difficulties we shared a deeper feeling of connection. Again it’s all too easy to bury these moments of vulnerability and put on a mask of competency.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    - In the larger working environment it’s important to be able to share our values (or at least be aware of them) so that we know what our boundaries are, that we have empathy for others so that we can work as a team instead of closed off from one another or worse in opposition to each other. Having real self awareness allows us to support each other in learning and in achieving. If you want to travel fast, travel alone. If you want to travel far, travel together.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
<br>
  <p>
    - Just how much we are all sharing the same feelings and the same frustrations and the same highs and many of the same hopes. We really do imagine our separateness more than exists in reality. Sometimes it is very comforting to let down the barriers and acknowledge our humaneness. Loop and live.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
<br>
  <p>
    - Bringing some self-compassion to the foreground while under pressure. The irony is that much of the pressure is self imposed and that the mental fizzing is a loop of our own making but it still one thing to point this out to another versus pointing it out to yourself *while* yourself is caught in that loop!
  </p>
<br>
<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
<br>
  <p>
    - If the vast majority of what a programmer, web developer does is wrestle with problems that are primarily of an abstract nature. Then having sound skills in acknowledging when, where and how you are being affected by the wrestling with those problems will go a long way to making you are far more competent problem solver and a far nicer person to be around when you aren’t getting your way with a problem! No one wants a stressed out colleague that can’t communicate because they have burnt through their buffer zones.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    Having a certain level of self awareness is also a good gateway to communication in all kinds of situations that go far beyond just solving problems.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
<br>
<p>- Waste of time? I would argue that they have been a valuable time saver.</p>
<br>
  <p>
    If not for focusing more on the “soft skills” such as the practicing of important skills like listening. I feel that I may have kept pounding on in isolation for much longer and with much less productive results. </p>
