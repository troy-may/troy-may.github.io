<h2>Elemental Positioning Practice</h2>
<p class=date>Sep, 08, 2021</p>


        <!--position static-->
        <h2>Position: static</h2>

        <p>A static element is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

        <div class="static">This div element has position: static;</div>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
        <!--position relative-->
        <h2>Position: relative</h2>

        <p>A relative element is positioned relative to its normal position. This element is indented from where it would normally be:</p>

        <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;</div>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
        <!--position fixed-->
        <h2>Position: fixed</h2>

        <p>A fixed element always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. <strong>Look</strong> down at the bottom right hand corner of your screen to see the fixed position element:</p>

        <div class="fixed">This div element has position: fixed;</div>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
        <!--position absolute-->
        <h2>Position: absolute</h2>

        <p>An absolute element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned parent-container (unlike the fixed element which is fixed in relation to the viewport):</p>

        <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
        <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
        </div>
<br>
<br>
<hr>

        <!--position sticky-->
        <div class="sticky"><strong>I'm a sticky element and I'm sticking around here.</strong></div>

        <div style="padding-bottom:800px">
        <p>The sticky element sticks to the top of the page, when you reach its scroll position. Can be used to annoy people to signup for your fabulous newsletters.</p>

        <p>Keep <strong>scrolling</strong> to see how sticky positioning works.</p>

        <p>Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.</p>

        <p>Some text to enable scrolling..</p>
        
        <p>When you’re up against a trouble, 
            Meet it squarely, face to face; 
        Lift your chin and set your shoulders, 
            Plant your feet and take a brace. 
        When it’s vain to try to dodge it, 
            Do the best that you can do; 
        You may fail, but you may conquer, 
            See it through!</p>

        <p>Black may be the clouds about you 
            And your future may seem grim, 
        But don’t let your nerve desert you; 
            Keep yourself in fighting trim. 
        If the worst is bound to happen, 
            Spite of all that you can do, 
        Running from it will not save you, 
            See it through!</p>

        <p>Even hope may seem but futile, 
            When with troubles you’re beset, 
        But remember you are facing 
            Just what other men have met. 
        You may fail, but fall still fighting; 
            Don’t give up, whate’er you do; 
        Eyes front, head high to the finish. 
            See it through!</p>
